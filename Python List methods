Python list methods are built-in functions that allow us to perform various operations on lists, such as adding, removing, or modifying elements. 
In this article, we’ll explore all Python list methods with a simple example.
List Methods
Let’s look at different list methods in Python:

append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.
copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the list.
clear(): Removes all elements from the list.
count(): Returns the number of times a specified element appears in the list.
extend(): Adds elements from another list to the end of the current list.
index(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified element.
insert(): Inserts an element at a specified position.
pop(): Removes and returns the element at the specified position (or the last element if no index is specified).
remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
reverse(): Reverses the order of the elements in the list.
sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order (by default).
